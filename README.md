~~You'll need to first run the tsc --watch command in a terminal to compile the typescript into JS, you might also need to crete the `/dist` folder if it gives you an error~~

Simple install the dependencies using `npm i` then run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` which uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle the typescript files into a javascript bundle at `/build/index.js` which runs in the browser.
